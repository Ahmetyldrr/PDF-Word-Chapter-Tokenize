As you’ve seen in this chapter, there are three main architectures for transformer models: encoders, decoders, and encoder-decoders. The initial success of the early transformer models triggered a Cambrian explosion in model development as researchers built models on various datasets of different size and nature, used new pretraining objectives, and tweaked the architecture to further improve performance. Although the zoo of models is still growing fast, they can still be divided into these three categories.
In this section we’ll provide a brief overview of the most important transformer mod‐els in each class. Let’s start by taking a look at the transformer family tree.
