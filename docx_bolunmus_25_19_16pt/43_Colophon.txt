The bird on the cover of Natural Language Processing with Transformers is a coconut lorikeet (Trichoglossus haematodus), a relative of parakeets and parrots. It is also known as the green-naped lorikeet and is native to Oceania.
The plumage of coconut lorikeets blends into their colorful tropical and subtropical surroundings; their green nape meets a yellow collar beneath a deep dark blue head, which ends in an orange-red bill. Their eyes are orange and the breast feathers are red. Coconut lorikeets have one of the longest, pointed tails of the seven species of lorikeet, which is green from above and yellow underneath. These birds measure 10 to 12 inches long and weigh 3.8 to 4.8 ounces.
Coconut lorikeets have one monogamous partner and lay two matte white eggs at a time. They build nests over 80 feet high in eucalyptus trees and live 15 to 20 years in the wild. This species suffers from habitat loss and capture for the pet trade. Many of the animals on O’Reilly’s covers are endangered; all of them are important to the world.
